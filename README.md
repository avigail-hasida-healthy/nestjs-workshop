# Nest JS Workshop

## What we are building

In this workshop, We will go through the journey of getting started with Nest. We will build a Mini Blog that's a Web RESTful API Application.

This simple Mini Blog application will cover:

Setting up Sequelize and in memory SQLite Database

Authentication with Passport (Login and Sign up)

Validating user input

Route protection with JWT

Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting a blog post

Setting up Swagger for api documentation

Lets start in the [Next Step: Setup](./001%20setup.md)
