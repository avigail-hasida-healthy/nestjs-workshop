# Setup

Install the NestJs CLI. Nest comes with an awesome CLI that makes it easy to scaffold a Nest application with ease. In your terminal or cmd run:

```bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

Now you have Nest installed globally in your machine.

On your terminal or cmd, cd into the directory where you want to create your application, and run following commands:

```bash
nest new nest-blog-api
cd nest-blog-api
npm run start:dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 on any of your browsers. You should see Hello World. Bravo! you have created your first Nest app. Letâ€™s continue.

> **NOTE**: As of this writing, if running npm run start:dev throws an error, change your typescript:3.4.2 in your package.json file to typescript:3.7.2 and then delete the node_modules and package-lock.json re-run npm i.

Your folder structure should look like this:

## Docker and Database Setup

Create a new `docker-compose.yaml` file in the root folder.

Copy and paste the following code:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  postgres-urine-service-dev:
    image: "postgres:alpine"
    ports:
      - 5438:5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: blog_dev
      POSTGRES_USER: blogger
      POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust
```

Run on the terminal

```bash
docker compose up
```

Now we have a running postgres database and can move on to the [Next Step: Database](./002%20database.md)
